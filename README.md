# ðŸš€ **The GitHub History of the Scala Language Project**

### **Project Overview**

Explore and analyze Scala's real-world project repository data with nearly 30,000 commits and over a decade of development history. Scala, a mature and versatile programming language, has gained recognition in the field of data science.

### **Steps**

1. **Data Collection:**
   - **Datasets:**
     - *pulls_2011-2013.csv:* Basic info about pull requests (late 2011 to 2013).
     - *pulls_2014-2018.csv:* Similar info for pull requests (2014 to 2018).
     - *pull_files.csv:* Details of files modified.

2. **Data Preparation and Cleaning:**
   - Combine data from two pull DataFrames.
   - Convert date strings to DateTime objects (UTC).

3. **Merging DataFrames:**
   - Merge two DataFrames into one.

4. **Project Activity Visualization:**
   - Chart monthly pull request counts.
   - Understand contribution evolution.

5. **Community Dynamics:**
   - Plot user pull request histogram.
   - Assess camaraderie and new contributor barriers.

6. **Recent Changes in Files:**
   - Identify files changed in the last ten pull requests.
   - Pinpoint active codebase areas.

7. **Contributors to a Specific File:**
   - Determine top developers for a specific file.
   - Gain insights into key contributors.

8. **Recent Contributors to a File:**
   - Identify users with the last ten pull requests to a file.
   - Understand recent contributors.

9. **Analyzing Developer Contributions Over Time:**
   - Analyze pull requests by developers over the years.
   - Understand key developers' contribution trends.

10. **Visualizing Developer Contributions to a Specific File Over Time:**
    - Examine developer experience with a specific file over time.
    - Measure pull requests for key contributors.
