## ðŸš€ Analyzing Crime in Los Angeles Project

### **Project Overview**

Welcome to the City of Angels! this project aims to analyze crime data to uncover patterns in criminal behavior. The insights gained will assist the LAPD in allocating resources effectively and implementing targeted crime prevention strategies across different areas of Los Angeles.

### **Steps**
1. **Identify Peak Crime Hour**
   - Determine the hour with the highest frequency of crimes and store it as an integer variable called `peak_crime_hour`.
2. **Locate Area with Highest Night Crimes**
   - Find the area with the largest frequency of night crimes (committed between 10 pm and 3:59 am) and save it as a string variable called peak_night_crime_location.
3. **Analyze Crimes by Victim Age Group**
   - Examine the number of crimes committed against victims in different age groups (<18, 18-25, 26-34, 35-44, 45-54, 55-64, 65+). Save the results as a pandas Series 
     called victim_ages.

### Steps

1. **Data Loading:**

##### Libraries:
- Pandas for data manipulation.
- Seaborn for visualization.
- NumPy for numerical operations.

2. **Most Commonly Awarded Gender and Birth Country:**
   - Identify and store the most commonly awarded gender and birth country among Nobel laureates.
3. **Proportion of USA-Born Winners Over Decades:**
   - Calculate the proportion of USA-born winners per decade.
   - Display the proportions of USA-born winners per decade.
   - Display the lineplot of USA Born Winners Over Decades
4. **Proportion of Female Laureates Over Decades:**
   - Calculate the proportion of female laureates per decade and category.
   - Visualize this with a relational line plot.
5. **First Woman Nobel Prize Winner:**
   - Identify and display information about the first woman to win a Nobel Prize.
6. **Repeat Winners:**

## ðŸš€ Soccer Goal Analysis

### **Project Overview**

This project, led by a sports journalist specializing in soccer analysis, investigates whether more goals are scored in women's international soccer matches compared to men's. The analysis utilizes statistical hypothesis testing and focuses on data from official FIFA World Cup matches since January 1, 2002.

### **Hypotheses**

- **Null Hypothesis (H0):** The mean number of goals scored in women's international soccer matches is equal to that of men's.
- **Alternative Hypothesis (H1):** The mean number of goals scored in women's international soccer matches is greater than that of men's.

### **Datasets**

Two datasets, namely `women_results.csv` and `men_results.csv`, have been compiled. These datasets contain results from official men's and women's international football matches since the 19th century.

### **Methodology**

 1. **Data Preparation**

   - The datasets are loaded and filtered to include only FIFA World Cup matches since January 1, 2002.

 2. **Data Transformation**

    - Relevant columns are selected, and a new column is created to represent the total goals scored in each match. This information is crucial for the subsequent analysis.

 3. **Hypothesis Testing**

    - The Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test is employed to compare the mean goals scored between women's and men's matches. The test is conducted using both the Pingouin and SciPy 
      libraries.

 4. **Result Interpretation**

     - The p-value obtained from the hypothesis test is analyzed. If the p-value is less than or equal to 0.01, the null hypothesis is rejected; otherwise, it is failed to 
       be rejected. The outcome is then summarized to provide a clear interpretation of the results.
