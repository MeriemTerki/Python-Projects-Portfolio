## ðŸš€ **The GitHub History of the Scala Language Project**

### **Project Overview**

Explore and analyze Scala's real-world project repository data with nearly 30,000 commits and over a decade of development history. Scala, a mature and versatile programming language, has gained recognition in the field of data science.

### **Steps**

1. **Data Collection:**
   - **Datasets:**
     - *pulls_2011-2013.csv:* Basic info about pull requests (late 2011 to 2013).

   - Assess camaraderie and new contributor barriers.

6. **Recent Changes in Files:**
   - Identify files changed in the last ten pull requests.
   - Pinpoint active codebase areas.

7. **Contributors to a Specific File:**
   - Determine top developers for a specific file.
   - Gain insights into key contributors.

8. **Recent Contributors to a File:**
   - Identify users with the last ten pull requests to a file.
   - Understand recent contributors.

9. **Analyzing Developer Contributions Over Time:**
   - Analyze pull requests by developers over the years.
   - Understand key developers' contribution trends.

10. **Visualizing Developer Contributions to a Specific File Over Time:**
    - Examine developer experience with a specific file over time.

## ðŸš€ **Furniture Retailer Campaign: Keyword Generation**

### **Project Overview**

Join our digital marketing agency in creating a powerful set of search keywords for a major online furniture retailer. The challenge? Craft a prototype campaign for sofas, convertible sofas, love seats, recliners, and sofa beds. The catch? Target price-sensitive customers with promotions and discounts, all while working within a tight budget.

### **Steps**

 1. **Unleash the Power Words**

Explore words that resonate with savvy shoppers: 'buy', 'price', 'discount', 'promotion', 'promo', and 'shop'.

 2. **Fusion of Words and Products**

Combine these impactful words with each furniture product, unleashing a dynamic array of search keywords.

 3. **Data Alchemy: DataFrame Creation**

Transform this fusion into a DataFrame, a canvas for crafting our campaign masterpiece.

4. **Renaming the Scene**

Give our DataFrame a polished look by assigning meaningful names to its columns.

5. **Campaign Chronicles**

Introduce a 'Campaign' column, giving our efforts a distinct identity - 'SEM_Sofas'.

6. **Crafting Match Types**

Create a 'Criterion Type' column, setting the stage with the precision of 'Exact' match.

7. **Echoes of Keywords: 'Phrase' Edition**

Duplicate the keyword symphony, this time embracing the versatility of 'Phrase' match.

8. **Save and Unveil**

Capture our campaign in a CSV file, ready for its grand entrance. Delve into a summary, a glimpse of our campaign's structure.
